This code defines optimization configurations for machine learning models in the `the-algorithm-ml` project. It provides a flexible way to configure different learning rate schedules and optimization algorithms for training models.

The code defines four learning rate schedules:

1. `PiecewiseConstant`: A piecewise constant learning rate schedule with specified boundaries and values.
2. `LinearRampToConstant`: A linear ramp-up learning rate schedule that starts from zero and ramps up to a constant value over a specified number of steps.
3. `LinearRampToCosine`: A linear ramp-up learning rate schedule that starts from zero, ramps up to a specified value, and then decays to a final value following a cosine curve.
4. `LearningRate`: A container class that holds one of the above learning rate schedules.

Example usage:

```python
lr_config = LearningRate(
    linear_ramp_to_cosine=LinearRampToCosine(
        learning_rate=0.1,
        final_learning_rate=0.01,
        num_ramp_steps=1000,
        final_num_steps=10000
    )
)
```

The code also defines three optimization algorithms:

1. `AdamConfig`: Configuration for the Adam optimizer, including learning rate, betas, and epsilon.
2. `SgdConfig`: Configuration for the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer, including learning rate and momentum.
3. `AdagradConfig`: Configuration for the Adagrad optimizer, including learning rate and epsilon.

These configurations are wrapped in the `OptimizerConfig` class, which holds one of the optimizer configurations and a learning rate schedule.

Example usage:

```python
optimizer_config = OptimizerConfig(
    learning_rate=lr_config,
    adam=AdamConfig(lr=0.001, betas=(0.9, 0.999), eps=1e-7)
)
```

Finally, the `get_optimizer_algorithm_config` function takes an `OptimizerConfig` instance and returns the selected optimizer configuration. This function can be used to retrieve the optimizer configuration for use in the larger project.

Example usage:

```python
selected_optimizer = get_optimizer_algorithm_config(optimizer_config)
```
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `one_of` parameter in the `pydantic.Field`?**

   The `one_of` parameter is used to indicate that only one of the fields with the same `one_of` value should be set. It enforces that only one of the specified options is chosen.

2. **How are the different learning rate configurations used in the `LearningRate` class?**

   The `LearningRate` class contains different learning rate configurations like `constant`, `linear_ramp_to_cosine`, `linear_ramp_to_constant`, and `piecewise_constant`. Each of these configurations represents a different way to adjust the learning rate during training, and only one of them should be set for a specific model.

3. **How does the `get_optimizer_algorithm_config` function work?**

   The `get_optimizer_algorithm_config` function takes an `OptimizerConfig` object as input and returns the selected optimizer configuration (either `adam`, `sgd`, or `adagrad`). If none of the optimizers are selected, it raises a `ValueError`.
