The code in the `tools` folder of the `json` directory provides utilities for working with parquet files, specifically focusing on reading and processing the data within these files. Parquet files are a columnar storage file format, which is optimized for use with big data processing frameworks. The main functionality is provided by the `PqReader` class in the `pq.py` file.

`PqReader` is designed to read parquet files and perform various operations on the data, such as displaying the first few rows, displaying unique values in specified columns, and showing the schema of the dataset. It uses the `_create_dataset` helper function to create a PyArrow dataset object from a given file path, which is then used to perform operations on the data.

The class has an `__init__` method that initializes the dataset, batch size, number of rows to read, and columns to read. The `__iter__` method allows the class to be used as an iterator, yielding batches of data from the dataset. The `_head` method reads the first `--num` rows of the dataset, while the `bytes_per_row` property calculates the approximate size of each row in bytes.

The `schema` method prints the schema of the dataset, which describes the structure and types of the columns. The `head` method displays the first `--num` rows of the dataset, while the `distinct` method displays unique values seen in specified columns in the first `--num` rows. This can be useful for getting an approximate vocabulary for certain columns.

This code can be used in the larger project to process and analyze data stored in parquet files. For example, it can be used to display the first few rows of a dataset or show the distinct values in specified columns. Here are some examples of how to use the `PqReader` class with command-line arguments:

To display the first 5 rows of a dataset:

```python
python3 tools/pq.py \
  --num 5 --path "tweet_eng/small/edges/all/*" \
  head
```

To display the distinct values in the "rel" column:

```python
python3 tools/pq.py \
  --num 1000000000 --columns '["rel"]' \
  --path "tweet_eng/small/edges/all/*" \
  distinct
```

In summary, the code in the `tools` folder provides a useful utility for working with parquet files, allowing developers to read and process data within these files efficiently. This can be particularly helpful in big data processing frameworks and can be integrated into the larger project for data analysis and processing tasks.
