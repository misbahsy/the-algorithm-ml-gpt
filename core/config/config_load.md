The code in this file is responsible for loading and parsing configuration files in the `the-algorithm-ml` project. These configuration files are written in YAML format and are used to store various settings and parameters for the project. The main function provided by this code is `load_config_from_yaml`, which takes two arguments: `config_type` and `yaml_path`.

`config_type` is a type hint that indicates the expected type of the configuration object that will be created after parsing the YAML file. This type should be a subclass of the `BaseConfig` class, which is imported from the `tml.core.config.base_config` module. This ensures that the parsed configuration object will have the necessary methods and properties expected by the rest of the project.

`yaml_path` is a string representing the path to the YAML configuration file that needs to be loaded and parsed. The function first opens the file and reads its contents into a string. It then uses the `_substitute` function to replace any environment variables or user-specific values in the file with their actual values. This is done using Python's `string.Template` class and the `safe_substitute` method, which allows for safe substitution of variables without raising an exception if a variable is not found.

After substituting the variables, the function uses the `yaml.safe_load` method to parse the YAML contents into a Python dictionary. Finally, it calls the `parse_obj` method on the `config_type` class, passing the parsed dictionary as an argument. This creates an instance of the configuration object with the parsed values, which is then returned by the function.

In the larger project, this code would be used to load and parse various configuration files containing settings and parameters for different parts of the project. For example, a user might create a YAML file with specific settings for a machine learning model, and then use the `load_config_from_yaml` function to load these settings into a configuration object that can be used by the model training code.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `_substitute` function and how does it work with environment variables and the user's name?

   **Answer:** The `_substitute` function is used to replace placeholders in the YAML file with the corresponding environment variables and the current user's name. It uses the `string.Template` class to perform safe substitution of placeholders with the provided values.

2. **Question:** What is the role of the `config_type` parameter in the `load_config_from_yaml` function?

   **Answer:** The `config_type` parameter is used to specify the type of configuration object that should be created from the parsed YAML file. It is expected to be a subclass of `BaseConfig`, and the `parse_obj` method is called on it to create the configuration object.

3. **Question:** How does the `load_config_from_yaml` function handle errors when parsing the YAML file or creating the configuration object?

   **Answer:** The `load_config_from_yaml` function does not explicitly handle errors when parsing the YAML file or creating the configuration object. If an error occurs, it will raise an exception and the calling code will need to handle it appropriately.
