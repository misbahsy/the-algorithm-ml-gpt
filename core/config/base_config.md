The `BaseConfig` class in this code serves as a base class for all derived configuration classes in the `the-algorithm-ml` project. It is built on top of the `pydantic.BaseModel` and provides additional functionality to enhance configuration validation and error handling.

The main features of this class are:

1. Disallowing extra fields: By setting `extra = pydantic.Extra.forbid`, the class ensures that only the defined fields are allowed when constructing an object. This reduces user errors caused by incorrect arguments.

2. "one_of" fields: This feature allows a subclass to group optional fields and enforce that only one of the fields is set. For example:

   ```python
   class ExampleConfig(BaseConfig):
     x: int = Field(None, one_of="group_1")
     y: int = Field(None, one_of="group_1")

   ExampleConfig(x=1) # ok
   ExampleConfig(y=1) # ok
   ExampleConfig(x=1, y=1) # throws error
   ```

The class also provides two root validators, `_one_of_check` and `_at_most_one_of_check`, which validate that the fields in a "one_of" group appear exactly once and the fields in an "at_most_one_of" group appear at most once, respectively.

Finally, the `pretty_print` method returns a human-readable YAML representation of the configuration object, which is useful for logging purposes.

In the larger project, this `BaseConfig` class can be used as a foundation for creating more specific configuration classes, ensuring consistent validation and error handling across different parts of the project.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question:** How does the `_field_data_map` method work and what is its purpose?
   **Answer:** The `_field_data_map` method creates a map of fields with the provided field data. It takes a `field_data_name` as an argument and returns a dictionary with field data names as keys and lists of fields as values. This method is used to group fields based on their field data, such as "one_of" or "at_most_one_of" constraints.

2. **Question:** How does the `_one_of_check` method ensure that only one field in a group is set?
   **Answer:** The `_one_of_check` method is a root validator that iterates through the `one_of_map` dictionary created by the `_field_data_map` method. For each group of fields, it checks if exactly one field in the group has a non-None value. If this condition is not met, it raises a ValueError with a message indicating that exactly one of the fields in the group is required.

3. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `pretty_print` method and how does it work?
   **Answer:** The `pretty_print` method returns a human-readable YAML representation of the config object. It converts the config object to a dictionary using the `dict()` method and then uses the `yaml.dump()` function to create a YAML-formatted string. This method is useful for logging and displaying the config in a more understandable format.
