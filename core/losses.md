This code defines loss functions for a machine learning project, specifically handling multi-task loss scenarios. The main functions provided are `build_loss`, `get_global_loss_detached`, and `build_multi_task_loss`.

`build_loss` creates a loss function based on the provided `loss_type` and `reduction`. It first calls the `_maybe_warn` function to check if the reduction is different from "mean" and logs a warning if necessary. Then, it returns a loss function that computes the loss between logits and labels using the specified loss type and reduction.

```python
loss_fn = build_loss(LossType.BCE_WITH_LOGITS, reduction="mean")
```

`get_global_loss_detached` calculates the global loss function using the provided reduction by performing an all_reduce operation. It logs a warning if the reduction is not "mean" or "sum" and raises a ValueError if an unsupported reduction is provided. The function returns the reduced and detached global loss.

```python
global_loss = get_global_loss_detached(local_loss, reduction="mean")
```

`build_multi_task_loss` creates a multi-task loss function based on the provided `loss_type`, `tasks`, `task_loss_reduction`, `global_reduction`, and `pos_weights`. It first calls `_maybe_warn` for both global and task loss reductions. Then, it defines a loss function that computes the loss for each task and combines them using the specified global reduction. The function returns a dictionary containing the individual task losses and the combined loss.

```python
multi_task_loss_fn = build_multi_task_loss(
    LossType.BCE_WITH_LOGITS,
    tasks=["task1", "task2"],
    task_loss_reduction="mean",
    global_reduction="mean",
    pos_weights=[1.0, 2.0],
)
```

The `_LOSS_TYPE_TO_FUNCTION` dictionary maps `LossType` enum values to their corresponding PyTorch loss functions. Currently, only `LossType.BCE_WITH_LOGITS` is supported, which corresponds to `torch.nn.functional.binary_cross_entropy_with_logits`.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `_maybe_warn` function and when is it called?
   **Answer:** The `_maybe_warn` function is used to log a warning when the provided `reduction` parameter is not "mean". It is called in the `build_loss` and `build_multi_task_loss` functions to ensure that the developer is aware of the potential issues with using a different reduction method in the distributed data parallel (DDP) setting.

2. **Question:** What are the supported reduction methods in the `get_global_loss_detached` function?
   **Answer:** The supported reduction methods in the `get_global_loss_detached` function are "mean" and "sum". Other reduction methods will raise a ValueError.

3. **Question:** How are the task-specific losses combined in the `build_multi_task_loss` function?
   **Answer:** The task-specific losses are combined in the `build_multi_task_loss` function using the specified `global_reduction` method, which can be one of the following: "mean", "sum", "min", "max", or "median". The combined loss is stored in the `losses` dictionary with the key "loss".
