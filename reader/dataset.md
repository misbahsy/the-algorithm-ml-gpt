The code defines a Dataset class that can work with or without distributed reading. It is designed to be extended by other classes to implement dataset-specific imputation, negative sampling, or coercion to Batch. The Dataset class is built on top of PyArrow, a library for working with Arrow data, and it supports reading data from various file systems and formats, such as Parquet.

The Dataset class has several key methods:

- `__init__`: Initializes the Dataset object with a file pattern and optional dataset keyword arguments. It infers the file system, validates the specified columns, and logs information about the files found.
- `_validate_columns`: Validates that the specified columns are present in the schema.
- `serve`: Starts a distributed reader flight server wrapping the dataset.
- `_create_dataset`: Creates a PyArrow dataset from a randomly shuffled list of files.
- `to_batches`: Generates batches of data from the dataset. It performs `drop_remainder` behavior to fix the batch size and shuffles the data at the file level on every repeat.
- `pa_to_batch`: An abstract method to be implemented by subclasses, converting a PyArrow RecordBatch to a DataclassBatch.
- `dataloader`: Returns a dataloader that maps the `pa_to_batch` method over the dataset batches. It supports both local and remote reading.

The code also defines a `_Reader` class, which is a distributed reader flight server that wraps a dataset. It inherits from `pa.flight.FlightServerBase` and implements the `do_get` method to return a `pa.flight.RecordBatchStream` from the dataset batches.

Additionally, the `get_readers` function is provided to create a list of readers connected to flight server addresses. It takes the number of readers per worker as an input and returns a list of connected readers.

In the larger project, the Dataset class can be extended to implement custom dataset processing and reading logic. The provided methods allow for efficient and flexible data loading, supporting both local and distributed reading scenarios. For example:

```python
class CustomDataset(Dataset):
    def pa_to_batch(self, batch: pa.RecordBatch) -> DataclassBatch:
        # Custom processing logic here
        pass

dataset = CustomDataset(file_pattern="path/to/data/*.parquet", batch_size=32)
dataloader = dataset.dataloader(remote=True)
```
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `_Reader` class and how does it interact with the `Dataset` class?
   **Answer**: The `_Reader` class is a distributed reader flight server that wraps a dataset. It is used to serve the dataset over gRPC for remote access. The `Dataset` class initializes a `_Reader` instance with itself as the dataset and serves it using the `serve()` method.

2. **Question**: How does the `dataloader()` method work with remote and non-remote data sources?
   **Answer**: The `dataloader()` method returns a generator that yields batches of data. If the `remote` parameter is set to `False`, it directly maps the `pa_to_batch` method to the output of `self.to_batches()`. If the `remote` parameter is set to `True`, it connects to remote readers using the `get_readers()` function and maps the `pa_to_batch` method to the output of `reader_utils.roundrobin(*readers)`.

3. **Question**: How does the `get_readers()` function work and what is its role in the code?
   **Answer**: The `get_readers()` function connects to remote flight servers (readers) and returns a list of connected readers. It is used in the `dataloader()` method when working with remote data sources to fetch data from multiple remote readers.
