This code provides an implementation of the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) metric using the Mann-Whitney U-test. The AUROC is a popular performance measure for binary classification problems, and this implementation is well-suited for low-CTR (Click-Through Rate) scenarios.

The main class in this code is `AUROCWithMWU`, which inherits from `torchmetrics.Metric`. It has three main methods: `__init__`, `update`, and `compute`. The `__init__` method initializes the class with a label threshold, a flag to raise an error if a class is missing, and additional keyword arguments. The `update` method appends predictions, targets, and weights to the class's internal state. The `compute` method calculates the accumulated AUROC using the `_compute_helper` function.

The `_compute_helper` function is a helper function that computes the AUROC given predictions, targets, weights, and other parameters. It sorts the predictions and targets based on their scores and true labels, calculates the weighted sum of positive and negative labels, and computes the AUROC using two different assumptions for equal predictions (weight = 1 or weight = 0). The final AUROC is calculated as the average of these two values.

Here's an example of how to use the `AUROCWithMWU` class:

```python
auroc_metric = AUROCWithMWU(label_threshold=0.5, raise_missing_class=False)

# Update the metric with predictions, targets, and weights
auroc_metric.update(predictions, target, weight)

# Compute the accumulated AUROC
result = auroc_metric.compute()
```

In the larger project, this implementation of the AUROC metric can be used to evaluate the performance of binary classification models, especially in cases where the predicted probabilities are close to 0 and the dataset has a low click-through rate.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `equal_predictions_as_incorrect` parameter in the `_compute_helper` function?
   **Answer**: The `equal_predictions_as_incorrect` parameter determines how to handle positive and negative labels with identical scores. If it is set to `True`, the function assumes that they are incorrect predictions (i.e., weight = 0). If it is set to `False`, the function assumes that they are correct predictions (i.e., weight = 1).

2. **Question**: How does the `AUROCWithMWU` class handle cases where either the positive or negative class is missing?
   **Answer**: The `AUROCWithMWU` class handles missing classes based on the `raise_missing_class` parameter. If it is set to `True`, an error will be raised if either the positive or negative class is missing. If it is set to `False`, a warning will be logged, but the computation will continue.

3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `label_threshold` parameter in the `AUROCWithMWU` class?
   **Answer**: The `label_threshold` parameter is used to determine which labels are considered positive and which are considered negative. Labels strictly above the threshold are considered positive, while labels equal to or below the threshold are considered negative.
