This code is responsible for importing key evaluation metrics and aggregation methods used in the `the-algorithm-ml` project. These metrics and methods are essential for assessing the performance of machine learning models and algorithms within the project.

The code imports three main components:

1. **StableMean**: This is an aggregation method imported from the `aggregation` module. The `StableMean` class computes the stable mean of a given set of values. This method is useful for calculating the average performance of a model across multiple runs or datasets, ensuring that the mean is not affected by extreme values or outliers. Example usage:

   ```python
   from the_algorithm_ml.aggregation import StableMean

   values = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
   stable_mean = StableMean()
   mean = stable_mean(values)
   ```

2. **AUROCWithMWU**: This is a performance metric imported from the `auroc` module. The `AUROCWithMWU` class calculates the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUROC) curve using the Mann-Whitney U test. This metric is widely used to evaluate the performance of binary classification models, as it measures the trade-off between true positive rate and false positive rate. Example usage:

   ```python
   from the_algorithm_ml.auroc import AUROCWithMWU

   true_labels = [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]
   predicted_scores = [0.1, 0.8, 0.3, 0.9, 0.6]
   auroc = AUROCWithMWU()
   score = auroc(true_labels, predicted_scores)
   ```

3. **NRCE** and **RCE**: These are performance metrics imported from the `rce` module. The `NRCE` (Normalized Relative Cross Entropy) and `RCE` (Relative Cross Entropy) classes compute the cross-entropy-based metrics for evaluating the performance of multi-class classification models. These metrics are useful for comparing the predicted probabilities of a model against the true class labels. Example usage:

   ```python
   from the_algorithm_ml.rce import NRCE, RCE

   true_labels = [0, 1, 2, 1, 0]
   predicted_probabilities = [[0.8, 0.1, 0.1], [0.2, 0.7, 0.1], [0.1, 0.2, 0.7], [0.1, 0.8, 0.1], [0.9, 0.05, 0.05]]
   nrce = NRCE()
   rce = RCE()
   nrce_score = nrce(true_labels, predicted_probabilities)
   rce_score = rce(true_labels, predicted_probabilities)
   ```

In summary, this code imports essential evaluation metrics and aggregation methods for the `the-algorithm-ml` project, enabling users to assess the performance of their machine learning models and algorithms.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `# noqa` comment in the import statements?

   **Answer:** The `# noqa` comment is used to tell the linter (such as flake8) to ignore the specific line for any linting errors or warnings, usually because the imported modules might not be directly used in this file but are needed for other parts of the project.

2. **Question:** What are the functionalities provided by the `StableMean`, `AUROCWithMWU`, `NRCE`, and `RCE` classes?

   **Answer:** These classes likely provide different algorithms or metrics for the project. `StableMean` might be an implementation of a stable mean calculation, `AUROCWithMWU` could be a version of the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve with Mann-Whitney U test, and `NRCE` and `RCE` might be related to some form of Relative Classification Error metrics.

3. **Question:** Where can I find the implementation details of these imported classes?

   **Answer:** The implementation details of these classes can be found in their respective files within the same package. For example, `StableMean` can be found in the `aggregation.py` file, `AUROCWithMWU` in the `auroc.py` file, and `NRCE` and `RCE` in the `rce.py` file.
