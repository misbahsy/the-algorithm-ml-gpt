The code in this file is responsible for setting up and managing configurations for the `the-algorithm-ml` project. It provides a function called `setup_configuration` that takes a Pydantic config class, a YAML file path, and an optional flag to substitute environment variables in the configuration.

The `setup_configuration` function reads the YAML file, optionally substitutes environment variables, and then parses the content into a Pydantic config object. This object is then returned to the caller, allowing the project to use the configuration settings in a structured and type-safe manner.

The function uses the `fsspec` library to read the file, which allows for a flexible file system interface. It also uses the `yaml` library to parse the YAML content and the `string.Template` class to perform environment variable substitution.

Here's an example of how the `setup_configuration` function might be used in the larger project:

```python
from tml.core.config import MyConfig
config, config_path = setup_configuration(MyConfig, "path/to/config.yaml", True)
```

In this example, `MyConfig` is a Pydantic config class defined in the project, and the function reads the configuration from the specified YAML file. If the `substitute_env_variable` flag is set to `True`, any environment variables in the format `$VAR` or `${VAR}` will be replaced with their actual values. If an environment variable doesn't exist, the string is left unchanged.

By using this code, the `the-algorithm-ml` project can easily manage and access configuration settings in a structured and type-safe manner, making it easier to maintain and extend the project.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `substitute_env_variable` parameter in the `setup_configuration` function?

   **Answer:** The `substitute_env_variable` parameter is used to determine whether to substitute strings in the format `$VAR` or `${VAR}` with their corresponding environment variable values. If set to `True`, the substitution will be performed whenever possible. If an environment variable doesn't exist, the string is left unchanged.

2. **Question:** What is the role of the `_read_file` function in this code?

   **Answer:** The `_read_file` function is a helper function that reads the content of a file using the `fsspec.open()` method. It takes a file path as input and returns the content of the file.

3. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `C` TypeVar in this code?

   **Answer:** The `C` TypeVar is used to define a generic type variable that is bound to the `base_config.BaseConfig` class. This allows the `setup_configuration` function to accept any class that inherits from `base_config.BaseConfig` as its `config_type` parameter, ensuring that the function works with different types of configuration classes.
