This code defines configurations for managing large embeddings in a machine learning project, specifically for the `EmbeddingBag` and `EmbeddingBagCollection` classes. It also defines an enumeration for data types and job modes.

The `DataType` enumeration has two values: `FP32` and `FP16`, representing 32-bit and 16-bit floating-point data types, respectively.

The `EmbeddingSnapshot` class is a configuration for embedding snapshots. It has two fields: `emb_name`, which is the name of the embedding table from the loaded snapshot, and `embedding_snapshot_uri`, which is the path to the torchsnapshot of the embedding.

The `EmbeddingBagConfig` class is a configuration for `EmbeddingBag`. It has several fields, including `name`, `num_embeddings`, `embedding_dim`, `pretrained`, `vocab`, `optimizer`, and `data_type`. The `pretrained` field is of type `EmbeddingSnapshot`, and the `optimizer` field is of type `OptimizerConfig`. The `data_type` field is of type `DataType`.

```python
embedding_bag_config = EmbeddingBagConfig(
    name="example",
    num_embeddings=1000,
    embedding_dim=128,
    optimizer=OptimizerConfig(),
    data_type=DataType.FP32
)
```

The `LargeEmbeddingsConfig` class is a configuration for `EmbeddingBagCollection`. It has two fields: `tables` and `tables_to_log`. The `tables` field is a list of `EmbeddingBagConfig` objects, and the `tables_to_log` field is a list of embedding table names that should be logged during training.

```python
large_embeddings_config = LargeEmbeddingsConfig(
    tables=[embedding_bag_config],
    tables_to_log=["example"]
)
```

The `Mode` enumeration defines three job modes: `TRAIN`, `EVALUATE`, and `INFERENCE`.

These configurations can be used in the larger project to manage and configure large embeddings, their snapshots, and collections of embedding bags, as well as to specify the mode in which the project should run.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `DataType` Enum class and how is it used in the code?
   **Answer**: The `DataType` Enum class defines two data types, FP32 and FP16, which represent 32-bit and 16-bit floating-point numbers, respectively. It is used in the `EmbeddingBagConfig` class to specify the data type of the embedding.

2. **Question**: How does the `EmbeddingSnapshot` class work and what is its role in the configuration?
   **Answer**: The `EmbeddingSnapshot` class is a configuration class that stores information about an embedding snapshot, such as the name of the embedding table and the path to the torchsnapshot of the embedding. It is used in the `EmbeddingBagConfig` class as an optional field to provide pretrained snapshot properties.

3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `LargeEmbeddingsConfig` class and how does it relate to the `EmbeddingBagConfig` class?
   **Answer**: The `LargeEmbeddingsConfig` class is a configuration class for the `EmbeddingBagCollection`, which is a collection of embedding tables. It contains a list of `EmbeddingBagConfig` instances, representing the configuration for each individual embedding table, and an optional list of table names to log during training.
