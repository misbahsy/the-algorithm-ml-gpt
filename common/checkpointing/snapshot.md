The `Snapshot` class in this code is responsible for checkpointing and restoring the state of a machine learning model during training using the `torchsnapshot` library. It provides methods to save and restore the model's state, as well as to load pretrained embeddings from a snapshot.

The `save` method takes a global step as input and saves a snapshot of the current state at the specified step. It uses the `torchsnapshot.Snapshot.async_take` method to create a snapshot asynchronously, ensuring that any state changes after the method returns do not affect the snapshot.

The `restore` method takes a checkpoint path as input and restores the model's state from the specified checkpoint. It handles cases where the checkpoint does not have the `walltime` attribute by setting it to 0.0.

The `get_torch_snapshot` class method returns a torch snapshot without actually loading it, while the `load_snapshot_to_weight` class method loads pretrained embeddings from a snapshot to the model using partial loading from `torchsnapshot`.

The `checkpoints_iterator` function is a simplified version of TensorFlow's `checkpoints_iterator`, which polls for new checkpoints and yields them as they become available. The `get_checkpoint` function retrieves the latest checkpoint or a checkpoint at a specified global step, and the `get_checkpoints` function returns a list of all checkpoints that have been fully written.

The `wait_for_evaluators` function waits for all evaluators to finish evaluating a checkpoint before proceeding. It uses the `checkpoints_iterator` to monitor the progress of evaluators and checks if they have marked the evaluation as done using the `is_done_eval` function. If all evaluators have finished or a timeout is reached, the function returns.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `Snapshot` class and how does it interact with `torchsnapshot`?
   **Answer:** The `Snapshot` class is used for checkpointing the model using `torchsnapshot`. It saves and restores the model state, updates the step and walltime, and provides methods for loading pretrained embeddings from a snapshot to the model.

2. **Question:** How does the `checkpoints_iterator` function work and what is its purpose?
   **Answer:** The `checkpoints_iterator` function is a simplified equivalent of `tf.train.checkpoints_iterator`. It polls for new checkpoints in the `save_dir` with a specified time interval (`seconds_to_sleep`) and a timeout (`timeout`). It yields the path of the new checkpoint when it becomes available.

3. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `wait_for_evaluators` function and how does it interact with the `is_done_eval` function?
   **Answer:** The `wait_for_evaluators` function waits for all evaluators to finish their evaluation on a specific checkpoint. It iterates through the checkpoints and checks if the evaluation is done for each partition using the `is_done_eval` function. If all evaluations are done or the timeout is reached, the function returns.
