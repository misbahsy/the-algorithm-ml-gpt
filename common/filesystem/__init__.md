This code is a part of a larger machine learning project and is responsible for handling file system operations. It imports three utility functions from the `tml.common.filesystem.util` module, which are used to manage and interact with different types of file systems. These functions are:

1. `infer_fs`: This function is used to determine the type of file system being used based on the given file path. It can identify whether the file system is a local file system or a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) file system. This is useful in cases where the project needs to work with different storage systems, and the appropriate file system operations need to be performed based on the storage type.

   Example usage:

   ```
   file_path = "gs://my-bucket/data.csv"
   fs = infer_fs(file_path)
   ```

2. `is_gcs_fs`: This function checks if the given file system object is a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) file system. It returns a boolean value, with `True` indicating that the file system is GCS and `False` otherwise. This can be used to conditionally perform GCS-specific operations when working with files stored in Google Cloud Storage.

   Example usage:

   ```
   file_path = "gs://my-bucket/data.csv"
   fs = infer_fs(file_path)
   if is_gcs_fs(fs):
       # Perform GCS-specific operations
   ```

3. `is_local_fs`: This function checks if the given file system object is a local file system. It returns a boolean value, with `True` indicating that the file system is local and `False` otherwise. This can be used to conditionally perform local file system-specific operations when working with files stored on the local machine.

   Example usage:

   ```
   file_path = "/home/user/data.csv"
   fs = infer_fs(file_path)
   if is_local_fs(fs):
       # Perform local file system-specific operations
   ```

In summary, this code provides utility functions to identify and work with different types of file systems, allowing the larger project to seamlessly handle files stored in various locations, such as local storage or Google Cloud Storage.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question:** What does the `infer_fs` function do in the `tml.common.filesystem.util` module?
   **Answer:** The `infer_fs` function is likely used to determine the type of filesystem being used, such as Google Cloud Storage (GCS) or local filesystem.

2. **Question:** How do the `is_gcs_fs` and `is_local_fs` functions work and what do they return?
   **Answer:** These functions probably take a path or a filesystem object as input and return a boolean value indicating whether the given path or object belongs to a Google Cloud Storage filesystem (`is_gcs_fs`) or a local filesystem (`is_local_fs`).

3. **Question:** Are there any other filesystem types supported by the `tml.common.filesystem.util` module besides GCS and local filesystems?
   **Answer:** Based on the given code snippet, it is not clear if there are other filesystem types supported. To determine this, one would need to review the complete `tml.common.filesystem.util` module or its documentation.
