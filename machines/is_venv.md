This code is a utility module designed to check if the Python script is running inside a virtual environment (venv). Virtual environments are isolated Python environments that allow developers to manage dependencies and avoid conflicts between different projects. In the larger project, this module can be used to ensure that the code is executed within a virtual environment, which is a best practice for maintaining clean and organized project dependencies.

The module contains two main functions: `is_venv()` and `_main()`. The `is_venv()` function checks if the current Python interpreter is running inside a virtual environment by comparing `sys.base_prefix` and `sys.prefix`. If they are different, it means the script is running inside a virtual environment and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

The `_main()` function is the entry point of the module when it is run as a script. It calls the `is_venv()` function and logs the result. If the script is running inside a virtual environment, it logs the path to the virtual environment (`sys.prefix`) and exits with a status code of 0, indicating success. If it is not running inside a virtual environment, it logs an error message and exits with a status code of 1, indicating failure.

To use this module in the larger project, it can be imported and the `is_venv()` function can be called to check if the code is running inside a virtual environment. Alternatively, the module can be run as a standalone script using the command `python -m tml.machines.is_venv`, which will execute the `_main()` function and exit with the appropriate status code.

Example usage:

```python
from tml.machines import is_venv

if is_venv():
    print("Running inside a virtual environment")
else:
    print("Not running inside a virtual environment")
```
## Questions: 
 1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `is_venv()` function?
   **Answer:** The `is_venv()` function checks if the current Python environment is a virtual environment (venv) by comparing `sys.base_prefix` and `sys.prefix`. It returns `True` if the environment is a virtual environment, and `False` otherwise.

2. **Question:** How does the `_main()` function use the `is_venv()` function?
   **Answer:** The `_main()` function calls the `is_venv()` function to determine if the current Python environment is a virtual environment. If it is, it logs an info message with the virtual environment's path and exits with a status code of 0. If it's not, it logs an error message and exits with a status code of 1.

3. **Question:** How is this script intended to be run?
   **Answer:** This script is intended to be run as a module, as indicated by the comment at the beginning of the code. The suggested way to run it is by using the command `python -m tml.machines.is_venv`.
