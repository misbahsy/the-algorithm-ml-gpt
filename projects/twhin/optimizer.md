This code defines a function `build_optimizer` that constructs an optimizer for a Twhin model, which is a part of the larger the-algorithm-ml project. The optimizer combines two components: an embeddings optimizer and a per-relation translations optimizer. The purpose of this code is to create an optimizer that can be used to train the TwhinModel, which is a machine learning model for knowledge graph embeddings.

The `build_optimizer` function takes two arguments: a `TwhinModel` instance and a `TwhinModelConfig` instance. The `TwhinModel` is the machine learning model to be optimized, and the `TwhinModelConfig` contains the configuration settings for the model.

The function first creates a `translation_optimizer` using the `config.translation_optimizer` settings. It does this by calling the `get_optimizer_class` function with the appropriate configuration settings. The `translation_optimizer` is then wrapped in a `KeyedOptimizerWrapper` to filter out the model's named parameters that are not part of the translation optimizer.

Next, the function constructs a learning rate dictionary (`lr_dict`) for each embedding table and the translation optimizer. This is done by calling the `_lr_from_config` function, which returns the learning rate for a given optimizer configuration.

The learning rate dictionary is then logged for debugging purposes. The embeddings optimizer (`model.fused_optimizer`) and the translation optimizer are combined using the `CombinedOptimizer` class from the `torchrec.optim.keyed` module. This creates a single optimizer that can be used to train the TwhinModel.

Finally, the function returns the combined optimizer and a scheduler, which is currently set to `None`. The scheduler could be used to adjust the learning rate during training, but it is not implemented in this code.

Example usage of this code in the larger project might involve calling the `build_optimizer` function with a TwhinModel and its configuration, and then using the returned optimizer to train the model:

```python
model = TwhinModel(...)
config = TwhinModelConfig(...)
optimizer, scheduler = build_optimizer(model, config)
train_model(model, optimizer, scheduler)
```
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `_lr_from_config` function and how does it handle cases when the learning rate is not provided in the optimizer configuration?

   **Answer**: The `_lr_from_config` function is used to extract the learning rate from the optimizer configuration. If the learning rate is not provided in the optimizer configuration (i.e., it is `None`), the function treats it as a constant learning rate and retrieves the value from the optimizer algorithm configuration.

2. **Question**: How does the `build_optimizer` function combine the embeddings optimizer with an optimizer for per-relation translations?

   **Answer**: The `build_optimizer` function creates a `translation_optimizer` using the `keyed.KeyedOptimizerWrapper` and the `translation_optimizer_fn`. It then combines the `model.fused_optimizer` (embeddings optimizer) with the `translation_optimizer` using the `keyed.CombinedOptimizer` class.

3. **Question**: Why is the `scheduler` variable set to `None` in the `build_optimizer` function, and what is the purpose of the commented-out line with `LRShim`?

   **Answer**: The `scheduler` variable is set to `None` because the current implementation does not use a learning rate scheduler. The commented-out line with `LRShim` suggests that there might have been a plan to use a learning rate scheduler in the past, but it is not being used in the current implementation.
