This code defines configuration classes for embedding tables in the `the-algorithm-ml` project. These classes are used to configure and manage large and small embedding tables, their optimizers, and other related settings.

`EmbeddingSnapshot` class is used to configure the snapshot properties of an embedding table. It has two fields: `emb_name` for the name of the embedding table, and `embedding_snapshot_uri` for the path to the torchsnapshot of the embedding.

`EmbeddingBagConfig` class is used to configure an EmbeddingBag, which is a container for embedding tables. It has fields like `name`, `num_embeddings`, `embedding_dim`, `pretrained`, and `vocab` to define the properties of the EmbeddingBag.

`EmbeddingOptimizerConfig` class is used to configure the learning rate scheduler and initial learning rate for the EmbeddingBagCollection (EBC).

`LargeEmbeddingsConfig` class is used to configure an EmbeddingBagCollection, which is a collection of embedding tables. It has fields like `tables`, `optimizer`, and `tables_to_log` to define the properties of the collection.

`StratifierConfig` class is used to configure a stratifier with fields like `name`, `index`, and `value`.

`SmallEmbeddingBagConfig` class is used to configure a SmallEmbeddingBag, which is a container for small embedding tables. It has fields like `name`, `num_embeddings`, `embedding_dim`, and `index` to define the properties of the SmallEmbeddingBag.

`SmallEmbeddingsConfig` class is used to configure a SmallEmbeddingConfig, which is a collection of small embedding tables. It has a field `tables` to define the properties of the collection.

These configuration classes are essential for managing the embedding tables in the larger project, allowing users to define and customize the properties of the embeddings and their containers.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `EmbeddingSnapshot` class and how is it used in the code?
   **Answer:** The `EmbeddingSnapshot` class is a configuration class for embedding snapshots. It contains two fields: `emb_name`, which represents the name of the embedding table from the loaded snapshot, and `embedding_snapshot_uri`, which represents the path to the torchsnapshot of the embedding. It is used as a field in the `EmbeddingBagConfig` class to store the snapshot properties for a pretrained embedding.

2. **Question:** What is the difference between `LargeEmbeddingsConfig` and `SmallEmbeddingsConfig` classes?
   **Answer:** The `LargeEmbeddingsConfig` class is a configuration class for `EmbeddingBagCollection`, which is used for large embedding tables that usually cannot fit inside the model and need to be hydrated outside the model at serving time due to their size. On the other hand, the `SmallEmbeddingsConfig` class is a configuration class for small embedding tables that can fit inside the model and use the same optimizer as the rest of the model.

3. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `StratifierConfig` class and how is it used in the code?
   **Answer:** The `StratifierConfig` class is a configuration class for stratifiers, which are used to control the distribution of samples in the dataset. It contains three fields: `name`, `index`, and `value`. However, it is not directly used in the code provided, so its usage might be present in other parts of the project.
