The code in the `embedding` folder is responsible for configuring and managing embedding tables in the `the-algorithm-ml` project. It provides a set of configuration classes that allow users to define and customize the properties of embedding tables and their containers, such as EmbeddingBag and EmbeddingBagCollection.

The `config.py` file contains several classes that define the configuration for different components of the embedding system:

- `EmbeddingSnapshot`: Configures the snapshot properties of an embedding table, including the table name and the path to the torchsnapshot of the embedding.
- `EmbeddingBagConfig`: Configures an EmbeddingBag, a container for embedding tables, with properties like the name, number of embeddings, embedding dimension, and vocabulary.
- `EmbeddingOptimizerConfig`: Configures the learning rate scheduler and initial learning rate for the EmbeddingBagCollection (EBC).
- `LargeEmbeddingsConfig`: Configures an EmbeddingBagCollection, a collection of embedding tables, with properties like the tables, optimizer, and tables to log.
- `StratifierConfig`: Configures a stratifier with properties like the name, index, and value.
- `SmallEmbeddingBagConfig`: Configures a SmallEmbeddingBag, a container for small embedding tables, with properties like the name, number of embeddings, embedding dimension, and index.
- `SmallEmbeddingsConfig`: Configures a SmallEmbeddingConfig, a collection of small embedding tables, with a field for defining the properties of the collection.

These configuration classes are essential for managing the embedding tables in the larger project, allowing users to define and customize the properties of the embeddings and their containers.

For example, to create a new EmbeddingBag configuration, you would use the `EmbeddingBagConfig` class:

```python
embedding_bag_config = EmbeddingBagConfig(
    name="example_embedding_bag",
    num_embeddings=1000,
    embedding_dim=128,
    pretrained=True,
    vocab=["word1", "word2", "word3"]
)
```

Similarly, to create a new EmbeddingBagCollection configuration, you would use the `LargeEmbeddingsConfig` class:

```python
large_embeddings_config = LargeEmbeddingsConfig(
    tables=[embedding_bag_config],
    optimizer=EmbeddingOptimizerConfig(),
    tables_to_log=["example_embedding_bag"]
)
```

These configurations can then be used to create and manage the actual embedding tables and their containers in the larger project. This allows developers to easily customize and configure the embedding system to suit their specific needs.
