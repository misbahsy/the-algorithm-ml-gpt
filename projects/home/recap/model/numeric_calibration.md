The `NumericCalibration` class in this code is a PyTorch module that performs a calibration operation on the input probabilities. The purpose of this calibration is to adjust the probabilities based on the positive and negative downsampling rates provided during the initialization of the class. This can be useful in the larger project when dealing with imbalanced datasets, where the ratio of positive to negative samples is not equal.

The class has two main parts: the `__init__` method and the `forward` method. The `__init__` method takes two arguments, `pos_downsampling_rate` and `neg_downsampling_rate`, which represent the downsampling rates for positive and negative samples, respectively. It then calculates the ratio of negative to positive downsampling rates and stores it as a buffer using the `register_buffer` method. This ensures that the ratio is on the correct device (CPU or GPU) and will be part of the `state_dict` when saving and loading the model.

The `forward` method takes a tensor `probs` as input, which represents the probabilities of the samples. It then performs the calibration operation using the stored ratio and returns the calibrated probabilities. The calibration formula used is:

```
calibrated_probs = probs * ratio / (1.0 - probs + (ratio * probs))
```

Here's an example of how to use the `NumericCalibration` class:

```python
import torch
from the_algorithm_ml import NumericCalibration

# Initialize the NumericCalibration module with downsampling rates
calibration_module = NumericCalibration(pos_downsampling_rate=0.5, neg_downsampling_rate=0.8)

# Input probabilities tensor
probs = torch.tensor([0.1, 0.5, 0.9])

# Calibrate the probabilities
calibrated_probs = calibration_module(probs)
```

In summary, the `NumericCalibration` class is a PyTorch module that adjusts input probabilities based on the provided positive and negative downsampling rates. This can be helpful in handling imbalanced datasets in the larger project.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question:** What is the purpose of the `NumericCalibration` class and how does it utilize the PyTorch framework?

   **Answer:** The `NumericCalibration` class is a custom PyTorch module that performs a numeric calibration operation on input probabilities. It inherits from `torch.nn.Module` and implements the `forward` method to apply the calibration using the provided downsampling rates.

2. **Question:** What are `pos_downsampling_rate` and `neg_downsampling_rate` in the `__init__` method, and how are they used in the class?

   **Answer:** `pos_downsampling_rate` and `neg_downsampling_rate` are the downsampling rates for positive and negative samples, respectively. They are used to calculate the `ratio` buffer, which is then used in the `forward` method to calibrate the input probabilities.

3. **Question:** How does the `register_buffer` method work, and why is it used in this class?

   **Answer:** The `register_buffer` method is used to register a tensor as a buffer in the module. It ensures that the buffer is on the correct device and will be part of the module's `state_dict`. In this class, it is used to store the `ratio` tensor, which is calculated from the input downsampling rates and used in the `forward` method for calibration.
