This code implements the MaskNet architecture, as proposed by Wang et al. in their paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.07619). MaskNet is a neural network model that uses mask blocks to learn representations from input data. The code defines two main classes: `MaskBlock` and `MaskNet`.

`MaskBlock` is a building block of the MaskNet architecture. It takes an input tensor and a mask input tensor, applies layer normalization (if specified), and then computes the element-wise product of the input tensor and the output of a mask layer. The mask layer is a two-layer feedforward neural network with ReLU activation. The result is then passed through a hidden layer and another layer normalization. The forward method of the `MaskBlock` class returns the final output tensor.

`MaskNet` is the main class that constructs the overall architecture using multiple `MaskBlock` instances. It takes a configuration object (`mask_net_config`) and the number of input features. The class supports two modes: parallel and sequential. In parallel mode, all mask blocks are applied to the input tensor independently, and their outputs are concatenated. In sequential mode, the output of each mask block is fed as input to the next one. Optionally, an MLP (multi-layer perceptron) can be added after the mask blocks to further process the output.

Here's an example of how the `MaskNet` class can be used:

```python
mask_net_config = config.MaskNetConfig(...)  # Define the configuration object
in_features = 128  # Number of input features
mask_net = MaskNet(mask_net_config, in_features)  # Create the MaskNet instance
inputs = torch.randn(32, in_features)  # Create a random input tensor
result = mask_net(inputs)  # Forward pass through the MaskNet
```

In the larger project, the MaskNet architecture can be used as a component of a more complex model or as a standalone model for various machine learning tasks, such as classification, regression, or representation learning.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `_init_weights` function and how is it used in the code?
   **Answer**: The `_init_weights` function is used to initialize the weights and biases of a linear layer in a neural network. It is applied to the `_mask_layer` and `_hidden_layer` in the `MaskBlock` class during their initialization.

2. **Question**: How does the `MaskNet` class handle parallel and non-parallel configurations for the mask blocks?
   **Answer**: The `MaskNet` class checks the `mask_net_config.use_parallel` flag to determine whether to use parallel or non-parallel configurations. If `use_parallel` is True, it creates multiple mask blocks with the same input and output dimensions and concatenates their outputs. If `use_parallel` is False, it creates a series of mask blocks with varying input and output dimensions, stacking them sequentially.

3. **Question**: How does the `MaskNet` class handle the optional MLP configuration?
   **Answer**: The `MaskNet` class checks if the `mask_net_config.mlp` is provided. If it is, the class initializes the `_dense_layers` with the MLP configuration and sets the `out_features` attribute accordingly. During the forward pass, the output of the mask blocks is passed through the `_dense_layers` if the MLP configuration is provided, otherwise, the output of the mask blocks is used directly.
