This code defines a set of PyTorch modules for preprocessing input features in a machine learning model. The primary purpose is to apply various normalization and transformation techniques to the input data before feeding it into the main model. The code is organized into several classes and functions, each responsible for a specific preprocessing step.

1. `log_transform`: A function that applies a safe log transformation to a tensor, handling negative, zero, and positive values.

2. `BatchNorm`: A class that wraps the `torch.nn.BatchNorm1d` layer, applying batch normalization to the input tensor.

3. `LayerNorm`: A class that wraps the `torch.nn.LayerNorm` layer, applying layer normalization to the input tensor.

4. `Log1pAbs`: A class that applies the `log_transform` function to the input tensor.

5. `InputNonFinite`: A class that replaces non-finite values (NaN, Inf) in the input tensor with a specified fill value.

6. `Clamp`: A class that clamps the input tensor values between a specified minimum and maximum value.

7. `DoubleNormLog`: A class that combines several preprocessing steps, including `InputNonFinite`, `Log1pAbs`, `BatchNorm`, `Clamp`, and `LayerNorm`. It applies these transformations to continuous features and concatenates them with binary features.

8. `build_features_preprocessor`: A function that creates an instance of the `DoubleNormLog` class based on the provided configuration and input shapes.

In the larger project, these preprocessing modules can be used to create a data preprocessing pipeline. For example, the `DoubleNormLog` class can be used to preprocess continuous and binary features before feeding them into a neural network:

```python
preprocessor = DoubleNormLog(input_shapes, config.double_norm_log_config)
preprocessed_features = preprocessor(continuous_features, binary_features)
```

This ensures that the input data is properly normalized and transformed, improving the performance and stability of the machine learning model.
## Questions: 
 1. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `log_transform` function and how does it handle negative, zero, and positive floats?
   **Answer**: The `log_transform` function is a safe log transform that works across negative, zero, and positive floats. It computes the element-wise sign of the input tensor `x` and multiplies it with the element-wise natural logarithm of 1 plus the absolute value of `x`.

2. **Question**: How does the `DoubleNormLog` class handle the normalization of continuous and binary features?
   **Answer**: The `DoubleNormLog` class first applies a sequence of transformations (such as `InputNonFinite`, `Log1pAbs`, `BatchNorm`, and `Clamp`) on the continuous features. Then, it concatenates the transformed continuous features with the binary features. If a `LayerNorm` configuration is provided, it applies layer normalization on the concatenated tensor.

3. **Question**: What is the purpose of the `build_features_preprocessor` function and how does it utilize the `FeaturizationConfig` and `input_shapes` parameters?
   **Answer**: The `build_features_preprocessor` function is used to create a features preprocessor based on the provided configuration and input shapes. It currently returns a `DoubleNormLog` instance, which is initialized with the given `input_shapes` and the `double_norm_log_config` from the `FeaturizationConfig`.
