This code defines a set of preprocessing classes and functions for the `the-algorithm-ml` project. These preprocessors are applied to the dataset on-the-fly during training and some of them are also applied during model serving. The main purpose of these preprocessors is to modify the dataset before it is fed into the machine learning model.

The code defines the following preprocessing classes:

1. `TruncateAndSlice`: This class is used to truncate and slice continuous and binary features in the dataset. It takes a configuration object as input and reads the continuous and binary feature mask paths. During the `call` method, it truncates and slices the continuous and binary features according to the configuration.

2. `DownCast`: This class is used to downcast the dataset before serialization and transferring to the training host. It takes a configuration object as input and maps the data types. During the `call` method, it casts the features to the specified data types.

3. `RectifyLabels`: This class is used to rectify labels in the dataset. It takes a configuration object as input and calculates the window for label rectification. During the `call` method, it updates the labels based on the window and the timestamp fields.

4. `ExtractFeatures`: This class is used to extract individual features from dense tensors by their index. It takes a configuration object as input and extracts the specified features during the `call` method.

5. `DownsampleNegatives`: This class is used to downsample negative examples and update the weights in the dataset. It takes a configuration object as input and calculates the new weights during the `call` method.

The `build_preprocess` function is used to build a preprocessing model that applies all the preprocessing stages. It takes a configuration object and a job mode as input and returns a `PreprocessModel` object that applies the specified preprocessors in a predefined order.
## Questions: 
 1. **What is the purpose of the `TruncateAndSlice` class?**

   The `TruncateAndSlice` class is a preprocessor that truncates and slices continuous and binary features based on the provided configuration. It helps in reducing the dimensionality of the input features by selecting only the relevant features.

2. **How does the `DownsampleNegatives` class work?**

   The `DownsampleNegatives` class is a preprocessor that down-samples or drops negative examples in the dataset and updates the weights accordingly. It supports multiple engagements and uses a union (logical_or) to aggregate engagements, ensuring that positives for any engagement are not dropped.

3. **What is the purpose of the `build_preprocess` function?**

   The `build_preprocess` function is used to build a preprocess model that applies all preprocessing stages specified in the `preprocess_config`. It combines the different preprocessing classes like `DownsampleNegatives`, `TruncateAndSlice`, `DownCast`, `RectifyLabels`, and `ExtractFeatures` into a single `PreprocessModel` that can be applied to the input data.
